Author: Group 5
Maintainer: Beth Reddy <ereddy7214@sdsu.edu>
Description: This package contains a dataset of #FIFA tweets scraped in California. The functions allow a user specified dataset to be used instead, but the default option is to use the provided FIFA California dataset. The functions allow the user to create maps based off of a certain keyword. The user can also create a word cloud of words in tweets, and a time series of when the tweets were tweeted. The user can perform a sentiment analysis on tweets using the sentiment score function. The data cleaning functions allow the user to remove rare words, non-alphabetical words, and set all words to lowercase for a more consistent word cloud.
